- Remove a maximum of macros, including these:
	* src/save/load_saved_game.c -> private macros (NBR_LINES and 
		NBR_CHARACTERS_IN_LINE)
- Remove unused libc headers.
- Consider keeping history of commands and allowing the use of arrow keys to 
navigate.
- Consider adding colors to text and maybe boldness and stuff like that.
