- Isolate the yes/no parsing into its own function which can be called from 
anywhere in the codebase without having to go back to the main loop. We stay 
there until we get an answer or a EOF (which means "no").

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Remove a maximum of macros, including these:
	* src/save/load_saved_game.c -> private macros (NBR_LINES and 
		NBR_CHARACTERS_IN_LINE)
- Remove unused libc headers.
- Consider keeping history of commands and allowing the use of arrow keys to 
navigate.
