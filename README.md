*Treasure Venture* is a text adventure game, which means it's interacted with 
through written commands, and only displays written text. There is no graphical 
element. *Treasure Venture* also contains a mini-game entitled 
"[Twenty Squares](https://github.com/LycorisDev/c_game_twenty-squares)", that I 
leave you to discover as well as the game itself. Both of these projects are 
written in C.
